# eiriasu

dozens of POSIX alias commands. This idea is inspired by Curt J Sampson.

## installation

```
./installer
```

## man page

```
$ eiliasu man
```

## add alias

```
$ eiliasu [alias name]
```

## import aliases you added to this git repo

```
$ ./update_scripts
```
this command helps if you want to preserve the aliases
you created. Then upgrade your forked eilias repo and
save it on th GitHub server XD
